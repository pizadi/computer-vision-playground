# Computer Vision Playground
A series of IPython notebooks which aim to guide you through the practical side of image processing and computer vision. I made these notebooks mostly to demonstrate how different concepts in these fields work and how they can be implemented.

These notebooks mainly use NumPy and OpenCV for image and data manipulation. A list of all used libraries can be found in the requirements file.
